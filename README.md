# FuelConsumption-Analysis2

This project is a simple Level 1 analysis of the FuelConsumption dataset. The goal is to explore basic relationships in the data using Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

## Features
- Linear Regression modeling with two predictors:
  1. `Engine Size` (x1)
  2. Another selected feature (x2)
- Calculation of performance metrics:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared (R2)
- Visualization of training and testing results using Matplotlib.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   
   git clone https://github.com/QueenAhllam/FuelConsumption-Analysis.git
   cd FuelConsumption-Analysis
